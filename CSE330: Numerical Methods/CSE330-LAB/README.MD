CSE330: Numerical Methods
Offered:

Pre-requisite: MAT216

Fixed Point Arithmetic, Polynomial Interpolation, Differentiation, Nonlinear Equations, Linear Equations, Least-Squares Approximation, Numerical Integration

Course Objectives
The course will help students to recognize the need for numerical analysis, and the importance of error analysis. They will learn various methods to linearize a polynomial, differentiate and integrate different functions by using approximations, and finally how to solve the linearized equation by using the laws of linear algebra, like Gaussian elimination, QR decomposition, etc.
