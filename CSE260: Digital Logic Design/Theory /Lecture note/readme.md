Objective 1 - Familiarization with different number systems and conversion

Objective 2 - Introduce Boolean logic operation and teach students how to use Boolean Algebra and K-maps to realize two-level minimal/optimal combinational circuits

Objective 3- Teach students other Boolean simplification methods such as Tabulation

Objective 4 - Expose students in the introductory design process of combinational circuits including MSI circuits

Objective 5 - Teach basic operation and analysis of sequential circuits using latches, flip-flops, counters, registers and memory elements
