🔗 Singly Linked List

This folder contains the implementation of a Singly Linked List — one of the fundamental linear data structures.

📘 Overview

A Singly Linked List is a sequence of nodes where each node contains:

Data — value stored in the node

Next — reference to the next node in the list

It allows dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion operations compared to arrays.
